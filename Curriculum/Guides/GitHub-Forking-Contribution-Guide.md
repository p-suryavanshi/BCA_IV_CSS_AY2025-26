# Guide: Forking, Working, and Contributing to the University GitHub Repository

## Overview

This guide helps you get started with GitHub using your personal email, fork the official Mandsaur University repository, work on your assignments, and contribute your work back to the university repository. This process will help you build your GitHub profile and prepare for future collaboration and interviews.

## Recommended Folder Layout (Important)

**Do NOT change the current folder structure for daily content.**

Daily content must remain inside:

```
ClassWork/Week-1/Day1-xxx.md
```

For new assignments (classwork tasks), use the following pattern:

```
ClassWork/Tasks/{student-roll-number}/Week-1/Day1.md
```

Example:

```
ClassWork/Tasks/24CSA3BCA####/Week-1/Day1.md
ClassWork/Tasks/24CSA3BCA####/Week-1/Day2.md
```

This ensures all student assignments are organized and easy to review.

## 1. Fork the Official Repository

1. Go to the official university repository on GitHub: https://github.com/MandsaurUniversity/BCA_IV_CSS_AY2025-26
2. Click the **Fork** button (top right) to create a copy in your own GitHub account.

---

## 2. Clone Your Fork Locally

Open PowerShell and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BCA_IV_CSS_AY2025-26.git
cd BCA_IV_CSS_AY2025-26
```
- Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.

---

## 3. Set Up Remotes

By default, your fork is called `origin`. Add the university repo as `upstream`:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/MandsaurUniversity/BCA_IV_CSS_AY2025-26.git
git remote -v
```
- `origin` = your fork (you can push here)
- `upstream` = official repo (you can pull from here)

---

## Syncing Your Fork with the Official Repository

### Why Sync?
When you fork a repository, your fork will not automatically receive updates from the original ("upstream") repository. To keep your fork up to date with the latest changes from the university repo, you need to manually sync it. Note: The command `git status` will NOT show if your fork is behind the upstream repository.

### How to Check and Sync Your Fork

#### 1. Fetch Latest Changes from Upstream

First, make sure you have the upstream remote set:

```bash
git remote -v
```
You should see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the university repo). If not, add upstream:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/MandsaurUniversity/BCA_IV_CSS_AY2025-26.git
```

Now fetch the latest changes from upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

#### 2. Check if Your Local Branch is Behind Upstream

To see if your local branch is behind the university repo, use:

```bash
git log HEAD..upstream/main --oneline
```
If you see a list of commits, your fork is behind and needs to be updated. If nothing is shown, your fork is up to date.

You can also see file differences with:

```bash
git diff HEAD upstream/main
```

#### 3. Merge Latest Changes from Upstream

Switch to your main branch (if not already on it):

```bash
git checkout main
```
Merge the changes:

```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

#### 4. Push Updates to Your Fork on GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

#### Example
Suppose the university repo added new files in `ClassWork/Week-1/Day2-xxx.md`. After syncing, you will have these files in your fork as well.

#### Troubleshooting


### Handling GitHub Authentication Issues When Pushing

Sometimes, when you push changes to your fork, you may see a 'permission denied' or 'remote rejected' error. This is usually due to authentication issues. Here’s how to resolve them:

#### 1. First-Time Users (Not Logged In via CLI)

If you have never logged in to GitHub from the command line:

- When you push for the first time, Git will prompt you for your GitHub username and password.
- **Note:** GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for HTTPS authentication. You must use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password.

**Steps:**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens.
2. Generate a new token (with repo permissions).
3. When prompted for password, paste your token.

#### 2. Switching Users (Authenticated as Wrong User)

If you are logged in as a different user or want to change credentials:

**Option A: Use Git Credential Manager (Recommended)**
1. Run:
	```bash
	git config --global credential.helper manager-core
	```
2. Next time you push, you’ll be prompted for credentials. Enter your correct GitHub username and PAT.

**Option B: Clear Saved Credentials for This Repo**
1. Run:
	```bash
	git credential reject
	```
	When prompted, enter:
	```
	protocol=https
	host=github.com
	```
2. Next push will prompt for new credentials.

**Option C: Save Credentials Locally for This Repo**
1. To save credentials only for this repo:
	```bash
	git config credential.helper store
	```
2. When you push, enter your correct username and PAT. Credentials will be saved in a `.git-credentials` file in your repo directory.

**To Check Current User:**
```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

**To Change User for This Repo:**
```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your@email.com"
```

If you see conflicts, resolve them in your editor, then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```

---

---

## 4. Daily Workflow

### a. Fetch Latest Changes from University Repo

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```
- This keeps your local repo up to date with the university repo.

### b. Create/Update Your Work

```bash
# Create or edit files as needed
code ClassWork/cw1.js
```

### c. Check Status

```bash
git status
```
- Shows changed files.

### d. Stage and Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add solution for assignment 1"
```
- `git add .` stages all changes.
- `git commit -m` saves your work with a message.

### e. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin main
```
- Uploads your changes to your fork on GitHub.

---

## 5. Submitting Work to University Repo (Pull Request)

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click **"Contribute"** > **"Open pull request"**.
3. Add a clear title and description (e.g., "Add Week 2 assignments").
4. Submit the pull request.
5. Instructor will review and merge if appropriate.

---

## 6. Resolving Conflicts

If your PR cannot be merged automatically, you may need to update your fork:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
# Fix any conflicts in your files
# After fixing:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```

---

## 7. Useful Git Commands (with Explanations)

- `git status` — See what’s changed.
- `git add <file>` — Stage a file for commit.
- `git add .` — Stage all changes.
- `git commit -m "message"` — Save your changes with a message.
- `git push origin main` — Upload your work to your fork.
- `git fetch upstream` — Get latest changes from university repo.
- `git merge upstream/main` — Merge university changes into your local repo.
- `git pull` — Fetch and merge from your current remote (usually origin).
- `git log` — View commit history.
- `git branch` — List branches.
- `git checkout -b new-branch` — Create and switch to a new branch.
- `git switch main` — Switch to main branch.

---

## 8. Building Your GitHub Profile

- Commit regularly with clear messages.
- Push your work after every session.
- Submit PRs for assignments and classwork.
- Keep your fork updated with the university repo.

---

## 9. Transition to University Email

Once you receive your university email:
- Update your GitHub email in settings.
- Instructor may add you as a collaborator or move to GitHub Classroom assignments.

---

## 10. Need Help?
- Ask your instructor during class or office hours.
- Refer to the official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com).

---

**This workflow ensures you can start building your GitHub presence and contribute to the university repository, even before official emails are provided.**
